Step 7 - 10 potential non-functional requirements grouped by ISO/IEC 25010 categories

Performance efficiency
- NFR-Perf-01: The ATM shall complete PIN authentication within 2 seconds under normal load.
- NFR-Perf-02: Cash dispensing operation (from confirmation to dispense start) shall not exceed 5 seconds.

Reliability
- NFR-Reliability-01: The ATM shall have an uptime of 99.5% monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance.

Security
- NFR-Sec-01: All card data and PIN entry shall be handled according to PCI-DSS standards and must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- NFR-Sec-02: After 3 consecutive invalid PIN entries, the card shall be blocked and flagged for review.

Usability
- NFR-Usab-01: User prompts and on-screen text shall be readable at a minimum of 14pt font and available in at least two languages.

Maintainability
- NFR-Maint-01: Diagnostic logs for the last 30 days shall be exportable by maintenance staff in a standard format (CSV or JSON).

Compatibility
- NFR-Compat-01: The ATM software shall integrate with the bank's authorization API using TLS 1.2+ and JSON REST endpoints.

Portability
- NFR-Port-01: The application should be deployable on both Linux and Windows hosts with platform-specific installers or containers.

(These are initial suggestions; exact thresholds may be refined during non-functional requirement workshops.)
